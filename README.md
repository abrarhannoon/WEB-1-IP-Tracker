<h1>IP Address Tracker</h1>

In this challenge, you'll be using two separate APIs together to create an IP Address Tracking app.

Brief

Your challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, you'll be using the IP Geolocation API by IPify. To generate the map, we recommend using LeafletJS.

</li>
<li>Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location
</li>
